Marnie's Guessing Game

Created by: Marnie Cannon

Project: Guessing Game 
The Guessing Game is a javascript and HTML homework project assigned as part of Code Fellows Foundations of Software Web Development course
(Autumn 2015).

References:
In creating the javascript for my guessing game, I referred to the "Javascript & JQuery" textbook by John Ducket. I also
looked up information on nesting "if" statements using "else if" at http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_if_else.asp

Jokes:

What's brown and sticky? ...A stick!!

Okay that was a crap joke. (Get it? brown and sticky? crap? ha ha ha!) Try this one:

A dog walks into a bar. He says to the bartender, "Hey barkeep! You ever seen a talking dog before?"  
The bartender says, "No, no I haven't." 
The dog says, "It's pretty amazing, right? How about a free drink for the talking dog?"
The bartender says, "Sure, suit yourself. The toilet's in the back."
