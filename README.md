Marnie's Guessing Game

Created by: Marnie Cannon

Project: Guessing Game 
The Guessing Game is a javascript and HTML homework project assigned as part of Code Fellows Foundations of Software Web Development course
(Autumn 2015).

References:
In creating the javascript for my guessing game, I referred to the "Javascript & JQuery" textbook by John Ducket. I also
looked up information on nesting "if" statements using "else if" at http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_if_else.asp
